Hi, this is Ireanne Cao (ixc3), looking at your Assignment A6.

At the end of this document is the output of our testing program and a table indicating
the points for each part. This grading feedback is designed to help you understand 
how you can improve your assignment. The final score will be out of 95 points.
The autograder awards a maximum of 75 points for correctness. The remaining 20
points will be manually awarded for style, print statements and proper control flow (e.g using loops
or if-statements appropriately).

Style
-----
File contains lines over 80 characters: -1
In reroll function, did not print an error message (using printer.print_rerolling)
when a reroll is supposed to occur for a specific die: -1
In reroll function, did not print out a new list of dice *once the reroll is
completed*: -1
Hard coded __str__ function, assuming five rows: -1
In __str__ function, did not construct string by iterating over rows using a for
loop or recursion: -2

Functionality
-------------
In the __init__ function, if dice_list is None then you still need to initialize
self.dice_list accordingly by making self.dice_list a list of n_dice Die objects.
This means that the tests for len(hand.get_dice()) < MIN_DICE and > MAX_DICE
also failed, but luckily for you, we are not deducting for that.

In the mask_valid function, you return too early if a character in the mask is
valid. By returning True in the for loop if False is not in bollist, you basically
return True or False depending only on the first character of the mask. This is
fine for False, since one invalid character means the whole mask is invalid, but
for True, one valid character does not necessarily mean the whole mask is valid
(what if there is an invalid character later in the mask?). For example, for the
mask '1a41b', your function returns True because '1' is a valid character, but
it should return False because there are invalid characters later.
